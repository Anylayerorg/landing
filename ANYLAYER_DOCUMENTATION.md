# Anylayer: Universal Trust Infrastructure
## Project Information Document (v1.1)

---

## 01. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Anylayer is a decentralized, multi-layered trust engine designed to provide universal reputation and identity for the modular web. By utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and AI-driven behavioral analysis, Anylayer enables a new era of capital efficiency where trust—not just collateral—powers the internet of value.

---

## 02. CORE MISSION & VISION
**The Problem**: Digital identity is currently fragmented. On-chain addresses are unreadable, reputation is siloed within individual apps, and privacy is often compromised for the sake of verification.

**The Solution**: Anylayer separates **Identity from Addresses** and **Trust from Exposure**. Our vision is a world where verifiable behavior creates portable ROI, allowing capital to flow with zero-friction while maintaining absolute user sovereignty.

## 03. THE MODULAR TRUST ARCHITECTURE
Anylayer comprises four specialized layers that work in parallel to secure the ecosystem:

### I. The Identity Layer (ANS)
*   **Protocol**: Anylayer Name Service (ANS).
*   **Function**: Provides a persistent, human-readable anchor (`.any`) for all digital behavior.
*   **Sovereignty**: Users own their identity independently of specific wallets or dApps.

### II. The Reputation Layer
*   **Engine**: AI + Human Behavioral Scoring.
*   **Mechanism**: Aggregates signals from on-chain activity (swaps, lending, governance) and off-chain verifyable credentials.
*   **Output**: A dynamic **Trust Index** that scales based on behavior.

### III. The Proof Layer
*   **Technology**: zk-SNARKs and selective disclosure.
*   **Purpose**: Confirms specific claims (e.g., "Score > 700") without revealing raw sensitive data.
*   **Security**: Prevents Sybil attacks and ensures data integrity.

### IV. The Utility Layer
*   **Integration**: SDKs, APIs, and Smart Contract Oracles.
*   **Ecosystem**: Powers trust-based lending, private payments, and autonomous AI agent verification.

## 04. THE ANS NAMING PROTOCOL
The Anylayer Name Service is the entry point for the "Efficiency Age."

### Naming Policy & Lifecycle
- **Character set**: a–z, 0–9, and hyphens (3–32 characters).
- **Ownership**: Confers a limited, revocable license to use and resolve the name.
- **Normalization**: Canonical formatting rules prevent visually confusable duplicates (anti-phishing).
- **Lifecycle**: Includes a base registration period, a **Grace Period** (30 days), and a **Redemption Period** (30–60 days).

---

## 05. REPUTATION & SCORING LOGIC
Anylayer turns behavior into a multiplier for capital utility.

### Scoring Vectors
- **Lending/Borrowing**: Historical repayment reliability.
- **Trading/Liquidity**: Volume and consistency across DEXs.
- **Governance**: Voting participation and community alignment.
- **Sybil Resistance**: Verifying "humanness" through reputation thresholds.

---

## 06. PRIVACY & ZERO-KNOWLEDGE FRAMEWORK
Anylayer's ZK-circuitry ensures that users "share claims, not data."

### Selective Disclosure Examples
- **Credit Verification**: "Verify my score is above 800" (without revealing the score).
- **Eligibility**: "Verify I am a verified human" (without revealing biometric or ID data).
- **Compliance**: "Verify I am not on a restricted list" (without revealing geo-location).

## 07. CAPITAL EFFICIENCY & MARKET IMPACT
By quantifying trust, Anylayer enables protocols to move past the inefficiency of over-collateralization.

### Zenith Suite Objectives
1.  **Lowering Borrowing Costs**: Trust-anchored credit reduces the need for high collateral ratios.
2.  **Increased Liquidity Utilization**: Unlocking dormant liquidity through verifiable risk-aware routing.
3.  **Atomic Settlement**: Real-time clearing of risk before transactions occur.
4.  **High-Fidelity ROI**: Precision-targeting of yield for the most reliable network participants.

---

## 08. DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM & INTEGRATION
Anylayer is designed for seamless integration into existing Web3 stacks.

### Integration Tools
- **Anylayer SDK**: Lightweight React and Next.js libraries for score retrieval.
- **Smart Contract Oracle**: Direct on-chain access to verified trust signals.
- **ZK-Proof API**: Endpoints for generating and verifying complex privacy statements.

---

## 09. GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE
The protocol is governed by community-driven policies to ensure long-term neutrality.

- **Administrative Holds**: Temporary holds can be placed for security risks or credible abuse reports.
- **Reserved Names**: Protected namespace for brands and protocol-level terms.
- **Dispute Resolution**: A transparent process for handling naming conflicts and reputation claims.

---

## 10. CONCLUSION
Anylayer is more than a name service; it is the **fundamental lubricant for the internet of value**. By bridging the gap between behavior and ROI, we are building the infrastructure for a truly capital-efficient, privacy-preserving world.

> **One Identity. Any App. Any Chain.**
